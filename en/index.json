[{"content":"The first in a series of posts about questions I get about GEITje.\n\u0026ldquo;Why did you create a language model?\u0026rdquo; I have received this question several times in recent weeks. Usually immediately followed by a follow-up question: \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t ChatGPT already exist?\u0026rdquo; Not a strange question, actually. Here are my three main reasons:\n1. Because open models are needed ChatGPT performs great in Dutch. If you have an application where you want to try a LLM, definitely go for ChatGPT or one of the OpenAI APIs. They are good and cheap, and you can whip up a solution in no time. And if you have a challenging use case: you can now even fine-tune their models on your data. But there are also disadvantages.\nFirstly, there are always cases where you do not want, can, or may send your data to OpenAI. Careful handling of data is important, especially with regard to the GDPR and the upcoming AI Act. Therefore, you are quickly bound to models that you can run locally on your own infrastructure, to keep your private data private.\nSecondly, OpenAI, despite the increasingly ironic company name, is not so open at all. They do not tell you what sources their models are trained on, what kind of filtering they apply, or even how large their models are. The only thing you get is a black box on their servers that you can talk to, and a technical report without meaningful technical reports. If you want to research the model, for example, to determine if there are certain biases present that are important for your application, then you\u0026rsquo;re out of luck. The only thing you can do is send text to it and study the text you get back, but all other more advanced options are off the table.\nFinally, open models offer an opportunity to build on each other\u0026rsquo;s work, and to give something back. This way, you collectively reach a much higher level than everyone is capable of on their own, and everyone benefits from that.\nOpen models are therefore needed, and good news: they are booming in 2023! But Dutch was unfortunately lagging behind, as the open-source world mainly focused on English, Chinese, and programming languages. A familiar story for those who have read my earlier blog post about BLOOM, although this time there were initiatives already heading in the right direction.\n2. Because we can What is needed to create a Dutch language model? And is it possible to do as a hobby project? Well, no, not if you want to build it from the ground up. Meta used 184,320 GPU hours for training Llama 2 7B, which consumed about 74,000 kWh. Such budgets are unattainable for the GPU-poor. And, suppose, you manage to conjure up free computing capacity somewhere. Then you still need to get 2,000 billion tokens of Dutch text to match the same amount of text that Meta used for LLaMA 2. And once you have trained a foundation model, you also have to create (or have created) tens of thousands of conversations to train your foundation model into a real chatbot.\nBut what if you make some smart and practical choices? What if you don\u0026rsquo;t start from scratch? What if you build on existing open source models, such as LLaMA 2 or Mistral? Despite it probably not being the intention, there apparently slipped enough Dutch text into their training data to be able to speak a decent word of Dutch. Not enough to hold a longer coherent conversation, and the knowledge about Dutch or Flemish subjects of those models is very limited, but it is certainly better than starting with nothing. The only thing you have to give up is some transparency. Unfortunately, little is known about what data these open source models are trained on.\nIf you start with such a pre-trained model, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need such gigantic amounts of text to train your language model. GEITje is trained on 10 billion tokens of Dutch text. Up to a few hundred billion tokens, it is relatively easy to come by material. Datasets of chat conversations to train a chatbot are not available for Dutch, but they are abundantly available in English. By using GPT-3.5 as a translator, you can convert ten thousand conversations from English to Dutch for less than 100 euros.\nThen you need to get GPUs. Yes, they are expensive to buy. And they are also expensive to rent from common cloud providers like AWS or Azure. But if you go for a cloud provider that has made GPUs their specialty, then it can all be a lot cheaper. Providers like Lambda Labs and RunPod can be up to 80% cheaper. If you manage to get your hands on a GPU, that is, as they are often all occupied. More on that in a later blog post.\n3. Because it is fun and educational The third reason is perhaps the most important one. It\u0026rsquo;s just an incredibly fun and educational project!\nI have been interested in language models for a long time, and that interest has only grown in the past year with the breakthrough of the LLMs. Reading about them is educational, and applying them even more so. But nothing gives you more insight into a model than having to train it yourself.\nTo make GEITje, I had to delve into the various foundation models and their pros and cons. I had to explore the quality of datasets, and I had to make decisions about selecting data. I had to find out what the different ways of evaluating models are, and which ones are applicable to Dutch. I had to parse datasets consisting of gigantic text files and split them into separate documents. I had to write training code, which gave me more insight into the details of 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers, accelerate and Datasets. I had to write and maintain an ever-growing README. I had to experiment with different ways of training on multiple GPUs at the same time, to come up with the most cost-efficient method. For the first time, I was able to see training graphs live in the cloud at Weights \u0026amp; Biases. I modified a Gradio interface to offer a live demo of GEITje chat.\nAnd finally, I simply had to debug training code and get it working in the cloud on rented GPUs. It\u0026rsquo;s quite an experience to solve a problem while not only seeing the minutes tick away on the clock but also directly on your own credit card.\nThis post was translated from the original Dutch with the help of GPT-4.\n","permalink":"https://goingdutch.ai/en/posts/why-geitje/","summary":"The first in a series of posts about questions I get about GEITje.\n\u0026ldquo;Why did you create a language model?\u0026rdquo; I have received this question several times in recent weeks.

A couple of weeks of work. That\u0026rsquo;s what it took to add a language to BigScience BLOOM, the open multilingual language model with no fewer than 176 billion parameters that was released mid-2022. It aimed to become an open and multilingual alternative to GPT-3. In the end, 46 languages from all over the world made it into the dataset BLOOM was trained on. Even relatively small languages like Basque and Catalan managed to be included. Dutch did not. How is that possible?\nBigScience, big dreams It all started in 2021. A group of more than 1,000 researchers united in the virtual research collective BigScience. Probably triggered by the capabilities of GPT-3 and concerned about the rise of large language models that were increasingly kept to themselves by big tech companies, they participated from May 2021 in a one-year open research workshop in the field of multilingual large language models.\nFunded by the French government and the French-American start-up Hugging Face \u0026mdash; one of the hottest companies in the field of AI \u0026mdash; they wanted to achieve two things:\ncompile a very large multilingual text dataset of high quality, later named ROOTS; and train a very large multilingual language model with it that could rival GPT-3: BLOOM. They wanted to do this as openly as possible. The model had to be downloadable by everyone, so that it could be used for applications where you can\u0026rsquo;t use closed models like GPT-3. For instance, if you have confidential data that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to send to some American tech company. Or if you want to investigate the model for possible biases before deploying it. Or if you simply want to know what data the model has and hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen during the training phase.\nTo achieve this, the goal was to involve researchers from all sorts of different fields and to examine the dataset and model from multiple perspectives:\nDuring the workshop, the participants plan to investigate the dataset and the model from all angles: bias, social impact, capabilities, limitations, ethics, potential improvements, specific domain performances, carbon impact, general AI/cognitive research landscape.\nThe whole initiative is also extensively described in three separate scientific papers: about the process, about the dataset, and about the model.\nThe BigScience working groups. Akiki, Christopher, et al. \u0026ldquo;BigScience: A case study in the social construction of a multilingual large language model.\u0026rdquo; arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.04960 (2022).\nBLOOM: open, ethical, and climate-friendly The result: BLOOM, the BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model, launched in July 2022. A large open language model with 176 billion parameters that has been trained in 46 different languages (and 13 different programming languages). It is available for everyone to download, study, and use1. Not only is the final model available, but intermediate checkpoints of the model from during the training have been shared with everyone.\nThe model was trained in 117 days on more than 3,000 GPUs of the French Jean Zay supercomputer. Cost? About 3 million euros. The French supercomputer is also the source of the claim of the model\u0026rsquo;s climate friendliness. BigScience proudly states that the required electricity was largely generated by nuclear fission. As a result, the training of the model resulted in low CO2 emissions.\nThe Jean Zay Supercomputer. © Photo Library CNRS/Cyril Frésillon\nThe focus on openness and ethics earned praise from the academic world. Researchers from Stanford University recently published a study on large language models. They mapped out which of the large language models already best meet the requirements of the draft text of the European Union\u0026rsquo;s AI Act. BLOOM scored by far the best. Radboud University also conducted a comparative study on the openness of language models (leaderboard, paper). The most open model? Once again, BLOOM.\nIn 2022, it became fashionable to consider every large language model as a foundation model, and to fine-tune such a model on chat conversations to create an interactive model similar to OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s InstructGPT. Therefore, a chat version of BLOOM was also released in early November 2022: BLOOMZ (website, paper, GitHub). Unfortunately, the buzz around it got somewhat lost in the frenzy surrounding ChatGPT, which was launched less than four weeks later.\nScores of large language models on the requirements of the AI Act. Bommasani, Rishi et al. \u0026ldquo;Do Foundation Model Providers Comply with the EU AI Act?\u0026rdquo; https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/15/eu-ai-act.html (2023).\nROOTS Corpus In order to train BLOOM, a dataset first had to be assembled: the ROOTS corpus. Here too, the focus was on openness and ethics. Dataset cards were published for all the datasets included in ROOTS. The data itself has been cleaned and deduplicated. Personal private information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and social media usernames have been automatically removed as much as possible. As a result, ROOTS has grown into a dataset of 1.6 terabytes of text data in 46 natural languages, supplemented with 13 different programming languages.\nThese 46 different languages form quite an interesting mix. Obviously, \u0026ldquo;high-resource\u0026rdquo; European languages such as English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese are not missing in this largely European project. In addition, Arabic and Chinese2 are also present. Finally, a number of \u0026ldquo;low-resource\u0026rdquo; languages have been deliberately added to the dataset, including several languages from the Niger-Congo language family for which there is little written text available.\nLanguages in the ROOTS corpus. Chart from the BLOOM model card.\nNotable missing languages? First and foremost: German. Additionally, Russian, and actually all Slavic languages, as well as the Scandinavian languages. And, of course, Dutch. However, relatively small languages such as Catalan and Basque are included. How can this be?\nLanguage Selection How was it determined which languages would be included and which would not? The answer is actually quite simple, but strangely enough, it is not found in the paper that describes the ROOTS corpus. Instead, it is discussed in the paper on BLOOM itself, on pages 10 and 11.\nLanguage Choices These considerations led us to an incremental process for choosing which languages were to be included in the corpus. We started with a list of eight of the world’s largest languages by number of speakers for which we did active outreach in the early stages of the project to invite fluent speakers to join the data efforts. Then, on the recommendation of language communities (Nekoto et al., 2020) we expanded Swahili in the original selection to the category of Niger-Congo languages, and Hindi and Urdu to Indic languages (Kunchukuttan et al., 2020). Finally, we proposed that any group of 3 or more participants fluent in an additional language could add it to the supported list if they would commit to selecting sources and guiding processing choices in the language in order to avoid common issues with corpora selected through automatic language identification without specific language expertise (Caswell et al., 2022).\nScao, Teven Le, et al. \u0026ldquo;Bloom: A 176b-parameter open-access multilingual language model.\u0026rdquo; arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.05100 (2022)\nVolunteers, then. To be precise: at least three volunteers who are fluent in the language and were willing to select sources, and were prepared to ensure that the processing of these sources was done correctly. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the exact details, but I estimate it at most a few weeks of work. Those were the costs to have the Dutch language benefit from a multi-million euro investment. Apparently, there were not at least three volunteers available who wanted or could do this for Dutch.\nMissed Opportunity? Could it have gone differently? Perhaps. I only heard about the existence of BigScience when it was already too late. Presumably, this is also the case for others in the Netherlands or Belgium who would have liked to contribute. Yes, if I wanted to participate, I would have had to find time somewhere. But with a clear goal in mind and the obvious interest we have as the Netherlands, I probably would have managed. It\u0026rsquo;s not often that you can benefit from someone else\u0026rsquo;s million-euro investment with a small time commitment. I probably have spent more time in meetings discussing consortia for hypothetical future Dutch language large language models than it would have taken to add Dutch to BLOOM.\nOn the other hand: despite all openness, BLOOM has not become the language model that made all other language models obsolete. With 176 billion parameters, it is indeed very large, but BLOOM is from an earlier generation than, for example, Meta\u0026rsquo;s LLaMA (70 billion parameters), which makes use of its parameters much more efficiently. In the 🤗 Open LLM Leaderboard, a list of the best-performing large language models, BLOOM-178B is not even included. Indicative of the lack of interest from the open-source community, I guess. A smaller variant of BLOOM, BLOOM-7b1 with \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; 7 billion parameters, is present, but it ranked somewhere in the bottom half. BLOOMZ — the chat version of BLOOM — is also not found on the leaderboard.\nBLOOM-7b1 on the 🤗 Open LLM Leaderboard.\nBut what does that leaderboard actually measure? Performance in English. The large open language models for Dutch are still very much in their infancy. To my knowledge, such a leaderboard does not even exist for Dutch.3 And if such a leaderboard for open Dutch language models were to exist: a hypothetical BLOOM that had also been trained on Dutch would be at the top of the list. In the lowlands of the blind, one-eyed would be king.\nLessons What lessons can the Dutch-speaking AI community take from this in my opinion?\nTo start with: we have to participate. The large American tech companies only see the Netherlands and the Dutch language as a side issue, and who can blame them? As speakers of a small language in a big world, we have to be opportunistic. If we can ride along on an existing initiative: free up capacity and do it! Volunteers wanted? We have them ready! Not just grandiose project plans, but also simple eager hands.\nWe must prevent being left behind next time. But that alone is not enough. We must, as a country — and therefore as a government — also invest in compiling, cleaning, and publishing Dutch-language datasets. Datasets for training, datasets for creating chatbots and agents, datasets for evaluating performance and measuring bias. We must bring those datasets to everyone\u0026rsquo;s attention. Publish them everywhere companies and academics looking to train a language model are acquiring their data. So not only on data.overheid.nl and the SURF Repository, but also on Github, on Hugging Face datasets, and on r/MachineLearning. Push our language until it can\u0026rsquo;t be ignored.\nDutch as something extra on the side. Not by chance, but as a national strategy.\nAnd it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there. As a society, we must ask ourselves why our domestic technology companies cannot currently play the same role for Dutch that big tech does for English. Where are the open models of Albert Heijn, Bol.com, Booking.com, and Just Eat Takeaway? And why can the National Growth Fund invest over 200 million euros in the AINed program, but then I find zero developed open-source datasets or models on their website?\nAnd while I\u0026rsquo;m at it: is there anyone out there even thinking about language models for Frisian?\nThis post was translated from the original Dutch with the help of GPT-4.\nStrictly speaking, the model is not open source.

It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the first time, nor the last, that the police managed to do this. It happens so frequently that there even exists a summary list of such operations against providers of cryptophones.\nIn practice, it turns out that some criminals feel extraordinarily safe using these cryptophones. They unabashedly transmit the most sensitive and incriminating messages without any obfuscation. Communication is key in the business world, apparently, no matter what kind of business you are in.\nDetecting threat-to-life messages Being able to read along is one thing, but when it comes to a large flow of messages, you want the police to be able to assess certain types of messages in a timely manner. For example, if discussions revolve around preparing for assaults, kidnappings, and assassinations, timely action must be taken to prevent these. So, something was needed: a threat-to-life detector.\nHerein lay the challenge: train a classification model that can find threat-to-life messages in large collections of non-threat-to-life messages from cryptophones. And although the task — classification — is not so innovative in itself, it is not trivial to get such a model off the ground. After all, you need to create a model that can handle the kind of language used in these messages: informal and riddled with street language and jargon. Quite different from the language you encounter when you scrape Wikipedia, for instance.\nIn addition, you must be able to gather enough training data — examples of the kind of messages you are looking for. And remember: these are relatively rare in the large stream of other messages. Kind of a chicken-and-egg problem actually.\nEuroPython 2023 You can see how we solved these problems in the live recording of my talk below. It was a relatively short talk for an audience of programmers, not necessarily data scientists. Therefore, I chose not to delve too deep into the details of the deep learning, and instead spent more time discussing the context of the entire story.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s why I think it gives a nice peek behind the scenes: it shows what you encounter when deploying AI for a case like this.\nDozens of serious violent crimes prevented And the result? In the police press release from July 2020, the preliminary balance of the police operation was disclosed. It also shows what the police have been able to do with the threat-to-life signals that emerged from the investigation.\nBelow is the preliminary balance:\nOver 100 suspects arrested for very serious crimes Nearly 20 million euros in cash seized The seizure of 8000 kilograms of cocaine and over 1200 kilograms of crystal meth 19 synthetic drug labs dismantled Also, dozens of firearms were taken off the streets In the Netherlands alone, over 3000 signals that seemed life-threatening were processed in the past few months. By intervening timely, the police were able to prevent dozens of serious violent crimes, including impending kidnappings, extortions, assassinations, and tortures. Today, three years later, Europol is still keeping score of the entire operation. According to them, the counter had reached over 6,500 arrests and almost 900 million euros in cash and assets have been seized.\nAnd now? Cryptophones and decrypted messages were and are still very relevant in criminal cases. This is further illustrated by a recent news article from NOS on how the digital department of the NFI managed to crack hundreds of individual cryptophones.\nThis post was translated from the original Dutch with the help of GPT-4.\n","permalink":"https://goingdutch.ai/en/posts/europython-2023-ttl/","summary":"I can\u0026rsquo;t often publicly share details about the kind of projects we undertake at the Netherlands Forensic Institute with the help of AI, but at the recent EuroPython 2023 in Prague, I was able to discuss a case that unfolded a few years ago and on which the NFI had previously issued a press release: the Threat-to-Life project.\nPolice could read along with criminals In 2020, the police managed to read live messages from a provider of so-called cryptophones: modified phones that — for a substantial payment — were used for encrypted communication in the criminal circuit.","title":"My talk at EuroPython 2023: \"Threat to Life — Preventing Planned Murders with Python\""}]
